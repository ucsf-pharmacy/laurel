# this file works with the responsive image module in Drupal 8 core (https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/responsive-image) to specify breakpoints for those images. since we are using drimage2 -- a version of drimage (https://www.drupal.org/project/drimage) customized by JH on our team -- we are not using the responsive_images module, and there is no need to use this file to specify breakpoints. this file has nothing to do with breakpoints used in other contexts such as media queries.
